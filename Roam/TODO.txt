TODO:
    turn viewmodels into environment objects
    implement firebase
    get accurate location data
    create listener + stopListening functions
    add appDelegate code to RoamApp.swift
    fix time issue -- look at hw6 code
    figure out what needs the @MainActor tag to make sure we are updating the UI on the main thread
    add firebase helper





App ideas that still need to be implemented:
    Home View:
        update the UI so that something is going on in the main part of the screen, currently is empty
    Globe View:
        implement a globe with all the previously saved locations
    Memory View:
        implement a filter:
            card view most recent - oldest
            nearest - furthest
            most unique (furthest away from all other entries or if starred)
            if starred, show the star icon
            would need to add stars to the data cards
